# Project architecture

![Package Diagram](..\project-architecture\PUML-diagrams\PackageDiagram.png)

## Modules

This project contains six modules in total: core, local persistence, ui, client, restserver & encryption. Each module contains these source directories:

<!-- rephrase: -->
<!-- **src/main/java** contains code for the module
**src/test/java** contains test code for the module

The ui module contains this in addition to the above:
**src/main/resources** contains all FXML files -->

### Core

<!--core contains blabla packages and these packages includes blabla classes that do this and that. -->

### Local Persistence

<!--local persistence contains blabla packages and these packages includes blabla classes that do this and that. -->

### UI

<!--The ui module contains blabla packages and these packages includes blabla controllers and fxml files that do this and that.

The user interface is created with JavaFX and FXML. All FXML files are connected to a controller blablabla. The FXML directory is located here. -->

### Client

<!--client contains blabla packages and these packages includes blabla that do this and that. -->

### Restserver

<!--restserver contains blabla packages and these packages includes blabla that do this and that. -->

### Encryption

<!-- encryption contains blabla packages and these packages includes blabla that do this and that. -->

## PlantUML diagrams

<!-- This package diagram illustrates the architecture of the Password Manager application. It shows how the components and packages relate to each other. The package diagram code can be found in the directory: **[PUML-diagrams](/design-documentation/project-architecture/PUML-diagrams)**. This directory also contains two class diagrams and one sequence diagram. The two class diagrams are **[server class diagram](/design-documentation/project-architecture/PUML-diagrams/ServerClassDiagram.png)** and **[client class diagram](/design-documentation/project-architecture/PUML-diagrams/clientClassDiagram.png)**. These diagrams show the most important parts of the system. The **[sequence diagram](/design-documentation/project-architecture/PUML-diagrams/SequenceDiagram.png)** illustrates how the client and server interact with eachother when a person adds workouts and view statistics.
