# Workflow

## Issues

We have used the GitLab issue tracker to keep track of our issues and milestones.

## Milestones

## Branches

## Merging

## Pipeline

We have also used the GitLab CI/CD
**pipeline** to run our tests and check our code quality so that we cannot merge without a quality check. We have
also used the GitLab merge request feature to ensure that we do not push directly to the master branch.

## Code quality

## Pair programming

Pair programming is an essential part of our workflow, we pair program to ensure that we understand the code and to
learn from each other. It is also helpful to cooperate with someone else when solving a difficult problem.

## Planning

We have two weekly meetings where we discuss our progress and what we need to do to finish the project, those meetings also consists of us coding together for several hours. If we see that two times a week is not enough, we will add more meetings. To ensure that most of us is present at each meeting, we have made a contract that we gives fines to each
person that are late to the meetings, this has worked very well since it is a more motivating factor to be on time to the meetings.
