# Release 3

## New features

For this release we have created a REST-API with springboot and implemented the functionality to copy passwords and delete profile. We have also implemented the functionality to encrypt and decrypt passwords. We have also implemented a new architecture, where we have seperated the persistence layer from the core layer. The new architecture is shown in the image below.

### UI

The UI has had a few functionalities added, as a few changes in the design, as well as a few bug fixes:

- The password field when creating a new profile now shows how strong the password is, ranking from weak to medium to strong. See image below.

- When adding a new profile, the user can now choose to generate a password for them, or write their own. The generated password will always be rated as strong. See image above.

- Copy and delete icons have been added to the profile list. The copy icon copies the password to the clipboard, and the delete icon deletes the password from the list. See image below.

- When either the title, username or password of a profile is too long, it will be cut off and made vertically scrollable.

- In the previous release, the exit "add profile overlay" button was not visible on all operating systems. This has been fixed, by changing from a X character to a X svg icon. See image below.

- Other minor improvements and bug fixes was also made, such as the window beeing blurred when the "add profile overlay" is visible, and the possibility to mark the text of the profiles.

## Code quality

For this release we implemented a new Maven plugin to ensure better code quality:

### Spotbugs

Spotbugs is a static analysis tool that looks for bugs in Java code. It is a plugin for Maven, and can be added to the pom.xml file. We also added Spotbugs to the pipeline, so that it will run every time the code is pushed to the repository. This will ensure that the code is bug free before it is merged to the master branch.

## Pipeline Jobs

<!-- new pipeline job "mvn clean install -DnoTestUI=true" blabla -->

## Workflow

Like we did when working with release 2, we used the GitLab issue tracker to keep track of our issues and milestones. We still used the GitLab CI/CD pipeline to run our tests and check our code quality, but we made some changes in the pipeline jobs (listed above). We used the GitLab merge request feature to ensure that we do not push directly to the master branch.



For this release we had atleast two meetings a week, where we discuss our progress and what we need to do to finish the project. Those meetings also consists of us coding together for several hours.
