# Release 2

## New features

<!-- A quick summary of the new features in this release. -->
As of Release 2, we have now a functional web application that allows users to create an account and password. The application also allows users to view their passwords in a list format. Altough the application is not yet fully functional, where it is not yet possible to create delete, edit passwords nor a application that encrypts passwords safely, it is still a great step forward in the development of the application. We have also spplitted the sourcecode into diffrent files and modules, which makes it easier to work with the code.

## Architecture

We have now split the application into two layers, Core, UI. The Core layer contains the logic of the application and the UI layer contains the user interface. We do have a third layer, which is the Prestistence layer, but we have not yet seperated it from the core layer. The prestistence layer will be seperated in the next release, where we will also implement the functionality to create, edit and delete passwords. The prestistence we have chosen to use is a JSON file, which will be stored on the users computer. The reason for this is that we want to keep the application as simple as possible, and we do not want to use a database. Jackson is the library we use to convert the JSON file to Java objects and vice versa. The architecture of the application is shown in the image below.

### Core

<!--blablabla hva som er i core og hva vi har gjort der-->

### Prestistence

All users, and their individual data, are stored within a JSON file. We used the Jackson library to
serialize and deserialize Java objects to JSON strings and vice versa. The JSON file is stored in the
**/src/main/resources/ui/ folder**.

### UI

We have created a desktop application using JavaFX. The UI is divided into three main parts, the login page, the register page and the password page. We have made a controller and a fxml-file for each page and a main controller to switch between the pages (*PasswordManagerController.java*).

We have updated the visual design for the whole application

## Code quality

For this release we implemented a few Maven plugins to ensure better code quality. We used the following tools to improve our code quality:

### Jacoco

We use Jacoco to check the test coverage of our project. After Jacoco has been run we are left with a html report where we see the percentage of the test coverage in each module.

<!--mvn kommando for å kjøre jacoco-->

### Checkstyle

We use Checkstyle to make sure that our code adheres to a certain coding standard. Our configuration file can be found in the **/passwordManager/config/checkstyle** folder. We use the Google Java Style Guide as our coding standard.

<!--mvn kommando for å kjøre checkstyle-->

### Spotbugs

We use Spotbugs to analyze our Java code for bugs.

<!--mvn kommando for å kjøre spotbugs-->

## Workflow and workhabits

We have used the GitLab issue tracker to keep track of our issues and milestones. We have also used the GitLab CI/CD **pipeline???** to run our tests and check our code quality so that we cannot merge without a quality check. We have also used the GitLab merge request feature to ensure that we do not push directly to the master branch.

Pair programming is an essential part of our workflow, we pair program to ensure that we understand the code and to learn from each other.

We have two weekly meetings where we discuss our progress and what we need to do to finish the project, those meetings also consists of us coding together for several hours. If we see that two times a week is not enough, we will add more meetings. To ensure that most of us is present at the meetings, we have made an contract that we gives fines to each person that are late to the meetings, this has worked very well since it is an more motivating factor to be on time to the meetings.
